- [X] ts_compound() should start at 1
- [X] unify ts_lag and ts_shift?

- [C] ts_window(), extend regular series, fill w NA?
- [X] ts_align vs ts_union, bad naming, one should be enough, -> ts_intersect, 
      only keep common time stamps, no need to regularize, unless its ts
      - removed altogther, they are confusing and unneeded. 
      ts_window(template = ) is probably more useful.

      
- [X] date_shift should prob become time_shift, mostly used internally 
- [X] if time_shift works ts_lag will work with high freq as well


- [ ] copy_class should be able to deal with length 1 series, so we can do
  ts_window(mdeaths, start = ts_end(mdeaths))

  This may give us some alternatives to ts_last("1 year").

  ts_window(AirPassengers, end = -1)         # everything except last obs
  ts_window(AirPassengers, start = "1 last") # only the last obs


- [ ] as.POSIXct(idx, origin = "1970-01-01"), whats the correct origin? This 
      almost surely isnt. Perhaps use ISODate?
- [ ]   # POSIXct merges only work well when converted to integer. Don't do this 
        # for Date
      Yes, but this is a rounding issue. Round everything to seconds for:

      mergers, widening etc? try to make this consistent

- [ ] ts_last("1 year"),  ts_last(1), same integer or character use as in ts_lag

- [ ] Avoid error when col order is wrong

- [ ] How useful are the date_ functions?
      for standard aggregation, we have now ts_frequency, 
      for nonstandard aggregation, e.g. hours to weeks, we need something like 
      lubridate anyway. Is there any usecase?


- [ ] ts_frequency with incomplete periods?


- Documentation

  - [ ] LONGTERM Documentation for auto generated ts_ functions.
        It would be nice if help is also available. 
        Can we do this? Ideally, the pop up rstudio should show what ts_seas is doing?

- Frequency Conversion

  - [ ] LONGTERM Conversion to higher frequency (needs tempdisagg update)

- Graph etc

  - [ ] LONGTERM legend in base plot: It would be to have a variable space 
        between entries, but not sure if possible
  - [ ] LONGTERM ts_iframe not sure if this belongs here, but it is just nice
        to create an iframe with a single command, as on www.dataseries.org
