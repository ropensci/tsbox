\title{Lag or Lead of Time Series}
\usage{
ts_lag(x, by = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{ts-boxable time series, an object of class \code{ts}, \code{xts}, \code{data.frame}, \code{data.table}, or \code{tibble}.}

\item{by}{integer or character, either the number of shifting periods
(integer), or an absolute amount of time (character). See details.}
}
\value{
a ts-boxable time series, with the same class as the input. If time
stamp shifting causes the object to be irregular, a data frame is returned.
}
\description{
Shift time stamps in ts-boxable time series, either by a number of periods or
by a fixed amount of time.
}
\details{
The lag order, \code{by}, is defined as in R base. Thus, -1 is a lag and +1 a lead
(dplyr uses an opposite definition).

If \code{by} is integer, the time stamp is shifted by the number of periods. This
requires the series to be regular.

If \code{by} is character, the time stamp is shifted by a specific amount of time.
This can be one of one of \code{"sec"}, \code{"min"}, \code{"hour"}, \code{"day"}, \code{"week"},
\code{"month"}, \code{"quarter" or}"year", optionally preceded by a (positive or
negative) integer and a space, or followed by plural "s". This is passed to
\code{\link[base:seq.Date]{base::seq.Date()}}. This does not require the series to be regular.

\examples{
ts_plot(AirPassengers, ts_lag(AirPassengers))
head(ts_lag(AirPassengers, "1 month"))
head(ts_lag(AirPassengers, "1 year"))
head(ts_lag(ts_df(AirPassengers), "2 day"))
# head(ts_lag(ts_df(AirPassengers), "2 min")) not yet working

shifting \code{Date} or \code{POSIXct} vectors.
