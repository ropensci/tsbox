## Writing ts-functions

It is straightforward to turn existing functions into functions that can deal
with any ts-boxable object.

The `ts_` function is a constructor function for tsbox time series functions. It
can be used to wrap any function that works with time series. The default is set
to R base `"ts"` class, so wrapping functions for `"ts"` time series (or vectors
or matrices) is as simple as:

```r
ts_rowsums <- ts_(rowSums)
ts_rowsums(ts_c(mdeaths, fdeaths))

```
Note that `ts_` returns a function, which can be with or without a name. Let' have a closer look at how `ts_rowsums` looks like:

```r
ts_rowsums
#> function (x, ...) 
#> {
#>     stopifnot(ts_boxable(x))
#>     z <- rowSums(ts_ts(x), ...)
#>     copy_class(z, x)
#> }

```

This is how most ts-functions work. They use a specific converter function
(here: `ts_ts`) to convert a ts-boxable object to the desired class. They then
perform the main operation on the object (here: `rowSums`). Finally they convert
the result back to the original class, using `copy_class`.


## Functions from external packages

Here is a slightly more complex example, which uses a post processing function:

```r
ts_prcomp <- ts_(function(x) predict(prcomp(x, scale = TRUE)))
ts_prcomp(ts_c(mdeaths, fdeaths))
```

It is easy to make functions from external packages ts-boxable, by wrapping them
into `ts_`.

```r
ts_dygraphs <- ts_(dygraphs::dygraph, class = "xts")
ts_forecast <- ts_(function(x) forecast::forecast(x)$mean, vectorize = TRUE)
ts_seas <- ts_(function(x) seasonal::final(seasonal::seas(x)), vectorize = TRUE)

ts_dygraphs(ts_c(mdeaths, EuStockMarkets))
ts_forecast(ts_c(mdeaths, fdeaths))
ts_seas(ts_c(mdeaths, fdeaths))
```

If you are explicit about the namespace (e.g., `dygraphs::dygraph`), 
`ts_` recognized the package in use and delivers a meaningful message if the 
package is not installed.

Note that the `ts_` function deals with the conversion stuff, 'vectorizes' the
function so that it can be used with multiple time series.

Let' have another look at `ts_forecast`:

```r
ts_forecast
#> function (x, ...) 
#> {
#>     load_suggested("forecast")
#>     ff <- function(x, ...) {
#>         stopifnot(ts_boxable(x))
#>         z <- (function(x) forecast::forecast(x)$mean)(ts_ts(x), 
#>             ...)
#>         copy_class(z, x)
#>     }
#>     ts_apply(x, ff, ...)
#> }
```

There three main differences here: First, the function requires the forecast
package. If it is not installed, `load_suggested` will ask the user to do so.
Second, the function in use is an anonymous function, `function(x)
forecast::forecast(x)$mean`, that also extracts the `mean` from the result.
Third, the function is 'vectorized', using `ts_apply`. This causes the process
to be repeated for each time series in the object.
