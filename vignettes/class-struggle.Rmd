There are many other time series classes, and it is relatively straightforward
to integrate them in tsbox. Here I try to briefly discuss each supported class,
starting with a very new one.

## tsibble

The [tsibble](http://pkg.earo.me/tsibble/) package provides a data class of
`tbl_ts` to store and manage temporal-context data frames in a tidy manner. A
tsibble consists of a time index, keys and other measured variables in a 
data-centric format, which is built on top of the tibble.

tsbox converters can be applied to tsibbles the usual way:

```r
suppressMessages(library(tsibble))
library(tsbox)

x.tsbl <- ts_tsibble(AirPassengers)
head(x.tsbl)
head(ts_xts(x.tsbl))
head(ts_ts(x.tsbl))
head(ts_df(x.tsbl))
# etc.

```

Here is a longer example, using the example from the tsibble documentation.

tsbox want deals with multiple time series in the long format, so we transform
the variables into the desired form, using `ts_long`:

```r
dta.tbl <- nycflights13::weather %>% 
  select(origin, time = time_hour, temp, humid, precip) %>% 
  ts_long() 
```

Next, we convert the tibble to a tsibble. Because tsbox guesses the time and the value and the key columns, calling `ts_tsibble` is sufficient:

```r
dta.tsibble <-
  dta.tbl %>% 
  ts_tsibble() 
```

With a long tsibble at hand, we can apply all usual functions from tsbox:
```r
dta.tsibble %>% 
  filter(id == "temp") %>% 
  ts_window(start = "2013-08-01") %>% 
  ts_trend() %>% 
  ts_plot() 
```

With the result being just the same as for any other ts-boxable object:
```r
dta.tbl %>% 
  filter(id == "temp") %>% 
  ts_window(start = "2013-08-01") %>% 
  ts_trend() %>% 
  ts_plot() 

```

### Aggregation, 3 ways

Some functionality is offered for tsibbles. The following shows how aggregation
can be performed using tsibbles, tibbles or any ts-boxable object:

#### the tsibble way

```r
a1 <- dta.tsibble %>%
  group_by(origin, id) %>%
  tsummarise(
    time = first_day_of_month(time),
    value = mean(value, na.rm = TRUE)
  )
```

#### the dplyr way

```r
a2 <- dta.tsibble %>%
  ts_tbl %>% 
  group_by(origin, id, time = first_day_of_month(time)) %>%
  summarise(
    value = mean(value, na.rm = TRUE)
  )
```

#### the tsbox way

```r
a3 <- dta.tsibble %>%
  ts_frequency("month", "mean") %>% 
  arrange(origin, id)
```

```r
all.equal(a1, a2)
all.equal(a1, a3)
```
